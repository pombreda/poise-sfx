#summary pyglet interface summary

= Introduction =

_this api is not implemented yet and is just here as a draft proposal_

The pyglet interface to POISE is implemented as a custom pyglet sound `Source`. It behaves just like any other pyglet Source, and streams its mixed audio data. 

The `PoiseSource` class can be found in `poise.pyglet`...
