#summary pyglet interface summary

= Introduction =

_this api is not implemented yet and is just here as a draft proposal_

The pyglet interface to POISE is implemented as a custom pyglet sound `Source`. It behaves just like any other pyglet Source, and streams its mixed audio data. 

The `PoiseSource` class can be found in `poise.pyglet`...

{{{
from poise.pyglet import PoiseSource
}}}

The `PoiseSource` can be constructed, then used like any other `Source` through a `Player`. Here an instance is queued on a pyglet `Player` and then played.

{{{
source = PoiseSource()
player = Player()
player.queue(source)
player.play()
}}}

In this default state, the source will be playing, but having no oscillators, only silence is generated.

To add an oscillator to a source, use the source's `add()` method. Pass in the oscillator generator, and an optional gain level for it to me mixed at.

{{{
source.add( 
    adsr(
        sine( freq=440.0, gain=-1 ),
        attack=0.1, decay=0.1, sustain=0.0, release=0.0
    ), 
    gain=-6
)
}}}

If the source is presently playing, the start of this sound will be immediate.
