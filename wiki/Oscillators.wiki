#summary POISE Oscillators

= Oscillators =

The POISE oscillators are imported from poise.osc

{{{
from poise.osc import sine, square, triangle, sawtooth
}}}

Each is a python generator that will generate buffers.

== sine ==

{{{
from poise.osc import sine
gen = sine( freq, gain )
}}}

generates a sine wave

frequency is in hertz. gain is in decibels.

== square ==

{{{
from poise.osc import square
gen = square( freq, gain )
}}}

generates a square wave

== sawtooth ==

{{{
from poise.osc import sawtooth
gen = sawtooth( freq, gain )
}}}

generates a sawtooth wave

== triangle ==

{{{
from poise.osc import triangle
gen = triangle(freq,gain)
}}}

generates a triangular waveform

== silence ==

{{{
from poise.osc import silence
gen = silence()
}}}

generates zeros. completely silent.

== noise ==

{{{
from poise.osc import noise
gen = noise(gain)
}}}

generates white noise.

gain is the waveforms instantaneous peak maximum level. Just straight random noise scaled to that gain.
