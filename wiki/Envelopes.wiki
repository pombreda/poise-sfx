source : source osciallator/generator

attack : attack time in seconds. Time to rise from noisefloor to attack gain.

decay : decay time in seconds. Time it takes to decay from attack gain to sustain gain.

sustain : how long in seconds to sustain at the sustain gain level

release : how long in seconds to fall back into the noise floor.

again : attack gain. peak level of attack. in decibels.

sgain : sustain gain. level of sustain in decibels.

noisefloor : the decibel level of 'silence'. default is good for most uses.
